# Toronto-Streetcar_Delay_Time_Classification

Machine Learning applications in public transit is one of the famous research topics in transportation management. With increments in
population and number of vehicle on road, problem of public transit delay becomes a significant transportation management issue in the city of Toronto. If delay pattern is recognized, passengers can have pro-active response when they travel with public transports. 

This project tries to recognize the pattern of Toronto Streetcar delay with respect to streetcar network design and streetcar delay details by Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). Multifactor pattern recognition model is applied for delay time classification.
